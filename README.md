    a reliable distributed system with a network of processors and disks. 
    Like the original Paxos algorithm, Disk Paxos maintains consistency 
    in the presence of arbitrary non-Byzantine faults. Progress can be 
    guaranteed as long as a majority of the disks are available, 
    even if all processors but one have failed.",

    the history and prophecy variables of Abadi and Lamport, as well as 
    the auxiliary variables of Owicki and Gries, Relationships between 
    the different types of simulations, as well as soundness and completeness 
    results, are stated and proved. Finally, it is shown how invariants 
    can be incorporated into all the simulations. Even though many 
    results are presented here for the first time, this paper can 
    also be read as a survey (in a simple setting) of the research 
    literature on simulation techniques. The development for untimed 
    automata is designed to support a similar development for timed 
    automata, Part II of this paper will show how the results of this 
    paper can be carried over to the setting of timed automata."
