abstract="We present an algorithm, called Disk Paxos, for implementing a reliable 
    distributed system with a network of processors and disks. Like the original 
    Paxos algorithm, Disk Paxos maintains consistency in the presence of arbitrary 
    non-Byzantine faults. Progress can be guaranteed as long as a majority of the 
    disks are available, even if all processors but one have failed.",

title = {Paxos Made Simple},
year = {2001},
month = {December},
abstract = {At the PODC 2001 conference, I got tired of everyone saying how difficult 
    it was to understand the Paxos algorithm, published in [122]. Although people got 
    so hung up in the pseudo-Greek names that they found the paper hard to understand, 
    the algorithm itself is very simple. So, I cornered a couple of people at the conference 
    and explained the algorithm to them orally, with no paper. When I got home, I wrote 
    down the explanation as a short note, which I later revised based on comments from 
    Fred Schneider and Butler Lampson. The current version is 13 pages long, and contains 
    no formula more complicated than n1 &gt; n2.},
